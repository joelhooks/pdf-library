MCP tool invocations as separate processes don't cleanly close the database. This led to 930 WAL files (930MB) and WASM memory exhaustion on init. Fix requires: checkpoints, WAL limits, graceful shutdown, transaction safety, and embedding validation.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-19T03:25:57.908Z","updated_at":"2025-12-19T14:36:45.070Z","closed_at":"2025-12-19T14:36:45.070Z","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}
